Worldgenerator, AKA MapMaker V1 was my first crack at making a map generator. This doesn't do height, it just maps out green land and blue oceans. Ultimately I just wanted something that could generate fantasy maps randomly, and while pretty ugly by the standards of what I would eventually be able to do, it was a first step in a long journey.

Created April 2023.
